**What are Containers**
Conatiners are completely osolated environments as in they can have their own Process or services, their own network 
interfaces or their own Mounts just like VM except they all share the same OS kernel.
Different types of containers are LXC/LXD/LXCFS. 
Docker utilizes LXC containers, setting up these container environment is very hard as ther are very low level 
and hence Docker offers a high level tools with several powerful funtionalities making it easy for end user like us.
